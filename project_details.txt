"architecture": "The architecture for the Fraud Detection System will be primarily based on a Python backend using Django for server-side logic, including fraud detection algorithms, data analysis, and API integrations. Since persistent storage is not utilized, the system will rely on in-memory data structures for real-time processing. The frontend will be built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and vanilla JavaScript, providing interactive dashboards for various user roles. Integration with external verification services and existing security systems will be achieved through RESTful APIs. The architecture will emphasize real-time processing, scalability, and compliance with data protection regulations."
